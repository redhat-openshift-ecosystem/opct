<!--
Do not change the following markdown commented lines.

This checklist should be provided for every new support case, or when any items have been changed (for Example, Compute flavor). This will help the Red Hat engineers while working in your partner support case during the validation process.

If you have any questions you can:

- Review the [Installation Review Guide](./user-installation-review.md)
- Review the [OpenShift Infrastructure Provider Guide](https://docs.providers.openshift.org/)
- Review the [OpenShift Documentation Page related to the version your are validating](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform)
- Ask your Red Hat Partner

### Load Balancers

Load Balancer deployment:

- [ ] I am using one Load Balancer dedicated to API
- [ ] I am using one Load Balancer dedicated to Ingress
- [ ] I am using the same Load Balancer for API and Ingress

- Load Balancer flavor/type used by API:
- Load Balancer flavor/type used by Ingress:

API Load Balancer details:

- [ ] I have reviewed all the Health Check requirements
- [ ] The Health Checks for kube-apiserver listeners are HTTP or HTTPS
- [ ] The DNS `api-int.<cluster>.<domain>` is properly configured with **private** Load Balancer address
- [ ] I have reviewed the Hairpin connection problem, and the Load Balancer used to kubernetes-api is not impacted by it
- [ ] The API load balancer is configured to take a maximum of 30 seconds from the time the API server turns off the `/readyz` endpoint to the removal of the API server instance from the pool.

### Component-specific Review

#### etcd

- [ ] I have checked the etcd logs while running OPCT
- [ ] I ran the etcd performance tool to measure the performance of the disk used by the mount point used by etcd(`/var/lib/etcd`) and it reported below than 10 ms (milliseconds).

*See more at [User Installation Review > Components > etcd](./user-installation-review.md#components-etcd)*

#### image-registry

- [ ] The persistent storage has been set to the Image Registry
- Describe the name of the persistent storage used on the internal image registry:

- [ ] I can push the image to the registry
- [ ] I can pull images from the registry
- [ ] I can create resources (deployment) with custom images
