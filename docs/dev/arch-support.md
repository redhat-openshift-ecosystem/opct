# OPCT Devel - Architecture support

OPCT projects are split into different components, each
component has its build process and dependencies.

## Client

The client (OPCT CLI) is built in the following platforms:

- linux/amd64
- linux/arm64
- darwin/amd64
- darwin/arm64
- windows/amd64

### Adding support to a new platform

The OPCT command line interface is built in Go language, to add support to a new OS/architecture
you need to:

- 1) Check if the Go toolchain used by [the project][go-mod] can build to the target architecture:
```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redhat-openshift-ecosystem/provider-certification-tool/main/go.mod | grep ^go
go version
go tool dist list
```
- 2) Modify the [Makefile][makefile] to build to the new architecture
- 3) Upddate the [CI release pipeline][ci-pipeline-release] to upload the CLI when new release is created

[makefile]: https://github.com/redhat-openshift-ecosystem/provider-certification-tool/blob/main/Makefile
[ci-pipeline-release]: https://github.com/redhat-openshift-ecosystem/provider-certification-tool/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yaml

## Server-side components

The following components are used by OPCT on the server side:

- Sonobuoy Aggregator Server
- Sonobuoy Worker
- Plugin openshift-tests
    - Must-Gather
    - Must-Gather Monitoring
    - etcdfio
    - camgi
    - openshift client
    - sonobuoy client
    - jq

### Server-side platforms

The components are built in the following platforms:

| Component | linux/amd64 | linux/arm64 | linux-s390x | linux-pp64le |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Sonobuoy Aggregator/Worker | yes | yes | yes | yes |
| Plugin openshift-tests | yes | yes | no | no |

### Supported platforms

OPCT can provide full feature coverage in the following platforms:

- linux/amd64
- linux/arm64

The regular execution can be done by running:

```bash
opct run --wait
```

### Limited platforms

In the other platforms, you should be able to run Kubernetes e2e tests
provided by Sonobuoy on the following platforms:

- linux/pp64le
- linux/s390x

The following command allows you to run such tests:

```bash
opct sonobuoy run --sonobuoy-image quay.io/opct/sonobuoy:v0.5.0-alpha.3
```

### Adding support to a new platform

The first requirement to support the new server-side platform is to ensure OpenShift/OKD
can provide payloads for that platform.

Once OpenShift is supported, each OPCT server-side component must be built to create a
full support.

The following components are required:

- Sonobuoy Aggregator Server/Worker
- Plugin openshift-tests
    - Must-gather
    - Must-gather monitoring
    - openshift client
    - sonobuoy client
    - jq

The following components are optional:

- Plugin openshift-tests:
    - camgi
    - etcdfio

#### Building Sonobuoy Aggregator and Worker image

See the release steps for more details how to mirror [Sonobuoy images](./release.md).

#### Building Plugin openshift-tests

See the [build script][build-sh], and the [Containerfile][containerfile-plugin-otests].

See the [introduced multi-arch PR #51](https://github.com/redhat-openshift-ecosystem/provider-certification-plugins/pull/51) for reference.

#### Building Must-Gather Monitoring

See the [build script][build-sh], and the [Containerfile][containerfile-mgm].
