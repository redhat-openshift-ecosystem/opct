title: Website architecture
---

## Technology

We use [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) for static site generation.

## Source Code

The website lives in `docs/` directory of [opct repository](https://github.com/redhat-openshift-ecosystem/provider-certification-tool).

## Theme

This site is based on [@material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme, with
customization defined under `theme` section defined on the `mkdocs.yaml` file under the root
directory of the repository.

## Navigation

Left menu is configured in `nav` section on `mkdocs.yaml`.

## Diagram as a code

`mkdocs` plugins are defined under `plugins` section on `mkdocs.yaml`.

### Using `diagrams`

You can write diagram as a code using python language with library
[]`diagrams`](https://diagrams.mingrammer.com/), the python file must be under
`docs/` directory and have suffix `.diagram.py`.

The image defined in `filename` can be used directly in your mardkown file, it is
rendered when the site is built or served locally.

For example, define the image name in the attribute `filename` of your `Diagram` of a
file `docs/diagrams/my-diagram.diagram.py`:

```py
with Diagram("OCP/OKD Cluster", show=False, filename="./cluster-example"):
```

The image `docs/diagrams/cluster-example.png` when you run `mkdocs build` or `mkdocs serve`.

You can reference the image in your markdown file `docs/diagrams/my-doc.md`, such as:

```md
![OCP Cluster Reference](./cluster-example.png)
```

### Mermaid.js

You also can draw diagram as a code with [`Mermaid.js`](https://mermaid.js.org/)
directly in markdown files.


allows you to write diagrams as a code, in python language,

The mkdocs plugins [`diagrams`](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/diagrams/)
enables native support for Mermaid.js diagrams.
Material for MkDocs will automatically initialize the JavaScript
runtime when a page includes a mermaid code block


## Articles

Articles/Guides are located in `docs/guides` in `*.md` files.

## Hosting

We use GitHub Pages as static website hosting and CD.

GitHub deploys the website to production after merging anything to a `main` branch.

## Local Testing

Install `mkdocs` and dependencies.

Run:

```sh
pip install -r hack/docs-requirements.txt
mkdocs serve
```

And navigate to `http://localhost:8000` after successful build.
There is no need to restart mkdocs server almost for all changes: it supports hot reload.
Also, there is no need to refresh a webpage: hot reload updates changed content on the open page.

## Website Build

To do it run:

```sh
make build-docs
```
